# MonoGameSamples
A few samples for MonoGame 3.3

(using Visual Studio 2013)

Here you will find really simple examples on how to get started with MonoGame, every sample is small and goes straight to the point; there are a few comments to put the emphasis on some subtleties.

- **MonoGameSample2dOrtho** : draw 2d lines  using 3d
- **MonoGameSample3dTriangle** : draw a rotating 3d triangle
- **MonoGameSample3dCube** : draw a rotating 3d cube using clockwise indices


and maybe a few more later ...

**Notes**:

- **it is recommended that you follow them in the above order** since repeated stuff is not commented on subsequent samples.
- basically if you are new to this kit and follow them in the above order, you are likely to get a good overview on how to achieve simple things in less than an hour. 
- **note the 3.3 version**, one of my motivation of writing this was the fact that my previous samples were not working anymore on this version; should you get a blank screen on a newer version then it would mean something has changed internally (though there's a low probability as time passes on). For your convenience, I have put the installer in the repository.

Enjoy !
